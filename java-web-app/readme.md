## Java Web App

This is a Java web application built with the [Spark microframework](http://sparkjava.com/), MYSQL and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and is hosted on Amazon Web Services(AWS) EC2. 

I developed this for the first project in the Cloud Computing class during FS2019. 

For a full list of supported features, refer the included [workflow documentation](./HW1.pdf)
