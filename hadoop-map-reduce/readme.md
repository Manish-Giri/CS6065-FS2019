## Hadopp Map-Reduce

This project uses Map-Reduce to process and analyze the [Berkeley-Stanford Web Graph](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-BerkStan.html) and then compute the relevant information, such as the node with the largest adjacency list, node with maximum connectivity, etc. 

Refer the included [project document](./Project_2_FS2019.docx) for the requirements, and the [submission document](./submission.docx) for relevant info. on how the Java code is organized and what it returns.
